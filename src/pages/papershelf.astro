        I’ve always been curious about how things work under the hood — not just
        how to use a tool or technology, but <strong>why</strong> it was built that
        way. That curiosity led me to start reading research papers and system design

        This page documents my journey through papers on distributed systems,
        cloud infrastructure, database internals, and general system design. I
        aim to read a few papers every month and curate the ones I find
        insightful.

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        I’m not summarizing these papers like a blog — instead, I’m collecting
        and linking to them here as a personal reading shelf. It's a way for
        both myself and others to refer back to important reads on backend
        design and infrastructure.
